<p align="center"><sup><strong>A dynamic mission for ARMA3 that generates small military encounters.</strong></sup></p>

The intent of the mission is to have something similiar to an Invade & Annex type missions, but in a smaler more infantry focused scope. There are always two tasks available. If both tasks are finished a cleanup will happen and 2 new tasks will be generated.

#### Currently there are 4 types of mission-sites with different tasks available:
#####Towns
- clear occupied town
- destroy 2 mortars
- destroy 2 resupply vehicles
- kill HVT and his Guards

#####Military Bases
- clear occupied base
- destroy 2 mortars
- destroy 2 resupply vehicles

#####Road-Positions
- clear broken down convoy
- clear road block / checkpoint

#####Installations
- destroy communication base (radiotower)
- recover UGV and return it to base (stomper)
- gather Intel from a compound

#### Rewards
for completing a set (2) of missions:
- MobileHQ / mobile respawn
- armed MRAP
- armed light helicopter

After completing two mission one vehicle will be spawned, starting with the MHQ. If one vehichle gets destoryed it will be respawned instead of spawning the next tiers vehicle. There won't be multiple iterations of the same vehicle. The reward vehicles can be found outside the Base in the Hangars.

#### The time is accelerated ( 4h IRL = 24h in game )
